### Advanced DAX Calculations (100+ Measures)

**Sample Key Measures:**

```dax
// Contact Rate Calculation
Contact Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Tasks, Tasks[CallDisposition] = "Contact")),
    COUNTROWS(Tasks),
    0
)

// Text Response Rate
Text Response Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(TextMessages[InboundCount]),
    SUM(TextMessages[OutboundCount]),
    0
)

// Average After Call Work (Seconds)
Avg After Call Work = 
AVERAGE(Tasks[AfterCallWorkSeconds])

// Positive Contact Percentage
Positive Contact % = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Tasks, 
        Tasks[CallDisposition] IN {"Interested", "Callback Scheduled", "Information Sent"}
    )),
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Tasks, Tasks[CallDisposition] = "Contact")),
    0
)

// Preview Denial Rate
Preview Denial Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Tasks, Tasks[CallType] = "Preview" && Tasks[Disposition] = "Denied")),
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Tasks, Tasks[CallType] = "Preview")),
    0
)
